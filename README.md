## Max K. Goff

This study compares machine learning approaches to evaluate and predict pysical exercise outcome based on proper weight lifting technques. Our expectation, based on the information provided on the web site, is that an effective predictive model can be built; our goal is to produce a model that will yield results with an error rate less than 1.0%.
